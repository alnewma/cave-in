# Cave-In

Cave-In is a 2D top-down exploration game built in Godot.

The game takes place in a collapsed road tunnel and focuses on:
- Exploring interconnected tunnel areas
- Scavenging items and supplies
- Fighting hostile animals
- Interacting with NPCs

Gameplay emphasizes exploration and resource management over fast-paced combat. The project is still in development and is intended as both a learning project and a base for a larger survival game.
